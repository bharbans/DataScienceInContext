## What is Keras?
Keras is a high-level neural networks API developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation.

- Allows the same code to run on CPU or on GPU, seamlessly.

- User-friendly API which makes it easy to quickly prototype deep learning models.

- Built-in support for convolutional networks (for computer vision), recurrent networks (for sequence processing), and any combination of both.

- Supports arbitrary network architectures: multi-input or multi-output models, layer sharing, model sharing, etc. This means that Keras is appropriate for building essentially any deep learning model, from a memory network to a neural Turing machine.[@falbel_2021]


## Installation of Tensorflow and Keras
In order to use Keras we need to install it. Instructions can be found on the [R-Studio Website](https://keras.rstudio.com/reference/install_keras.html). However, it is as simple as running the following commands. [@falbel_chollet_allaire].

```{r, eval = F, include = T, echo = T}
install.packages("keras")
library(keras)
install_keras()
```

## The Sample Dataset

For this presentation I will be using the MNIST Dataset[@yann_lecun_corinna_cortes_burges]. This is comprised of a training set of 60,000 examples of hand written digits, and a testing set of 10,000 digits. I will be using Keras to create a classification model for this dataset.[@allaire]

## Load the Dataset

```{r load_mnist, echo=T}
mnist_data <- dataset_mnist()

train_data_images <- mnist_data$train$x
train_data_classification <- mnist_data$train$y

test_data_image <- mnist_data$test$x
test_data_classification <- mnist_data$test$y

```

## Resize Images for Model
The `train_data_images` and `test_data_image` data is a 3-d array (images,width,height) of grayscale values . To prepare the data for training we convert the 3-d arrays into matrices by reshaping width and height into a single dimension (28x28 images are flattened into length 784 vectors). Then, we convert the grayscale values from integers ranging between 0 to 255 into floating point values ranging between 0 and 1: [@allaire]

```{r array-reshape-and-categorize-data}
train_data_images <- array_reshape(train_data_images, c(nrow(train_data_images), 784))
test_data_image <- array_reshape( test_data_image, c(nrow(test_data_image), 784) )

train_data_classification <- to_categorical(train_data_classification, 10)
test_data_classification <- to_categorical(test_data_classification, 10)

```

### Create Model

```{r create-model}
model <- keras_model_sequential() 
model %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 256, activation = 'relu', input_shape = c(784)) %>% 
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.4) %>% 
  layer_dense(units = 128, activation = 'relu') %>%
  layer_dropout(rate = 0.3) %>%
  layer_dense(units = 10, activation = 'softmax')
```
[@allaire]

### Compile Model
```{r compile-model}
model %>% compile(
  loss = 'categorical_crossentropy',
  optimizer = optimizer_rmsprop(),
  metrics = c('accuracy')
)
```
[@allaire]
### Fit Model
```{r fit-model, message=F}
history <- model %>% fit(
  train_data_images, train_data_classification, 
  epochs = 30, batch_size = 128, 
  validation_split = 0.2
)
plot(history)
```
[@allaire]

### Testing Model

```{r test-model}
model %>% evaluate(test_data_image, test_data_classification)
```
[@allaire]

### Show Predicted Classes
```{r }
model %>% predict_classes(test_data_image)
```
